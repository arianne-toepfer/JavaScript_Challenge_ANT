# JavaScript_Challenge_ANT
For this challenge we were tasked to update a UFO website to enable a filter which allowed the user to look up particular UFO sitings by date. The most difficult part about this assignment for me was geting the button and form event handlers to talk to the runEnter function. Luckily I realized my buttons were not commuicating with my runEnter function because my console.log inputs were not popping up in my brower inspect. With that in mind I could solve my error.

Here is an example of a filtered date and what that item looks like in the google inspection console as well:

The rest of the site functions as intended, although it still seems to reset if I hit enter after the date instead of "Filter Table".
